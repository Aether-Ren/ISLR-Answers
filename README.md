Online course available from: http://statlearning.class.stanford.edu/.

Complete R Markdown files with the code and answers are shown above. Additionally, here is the link to PDF outputs: https://onmee.github.io/ISLR-Solutions/

RStudio is a great IDE for R, and would be my recommendation for this course.

There will certainly be some errors in my answers, so use your own critical judgment for confirmation.
